### Why C++
As you know I love the C++ programming language, because you can combine i.e. hardware programming with software engineering. I do like the freedom to do whatever I like to do, to develop whatever I like to develop and to get the worst or the best out of my system. Yes, it may be hard sometimes, but do you know this moment, if something worked out, which first wasn't? Then you can understand, why I appreciate the development of this language that much. Programming can be easy sometimes, but with C++ most of the time, you will be facing different problems and need to solve them. This is, what makes this language alive.
